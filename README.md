### Case Studies:
When I working on the project I faces some problem like table responsive on small devices.I solve the problem like: first wrap the table another div and this div give a classname overflow-x: auto;

As for better responsiveness ,Tailwind css is best now,so I use Tailwindcss for style and for UI I use ReactJs.I have tried best practice code for other developer readability and better understandability.I spent about 5 hours for project including project understanding,project setup,complete project,facing problem and solve it and write readme file.thanks:
